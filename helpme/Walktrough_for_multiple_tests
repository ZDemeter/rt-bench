%Guide for running rt-bench on multiple .json files with xlaunch.sh%
%------------------------------------------------------------------%

1. Create folder for input
--------------
##############

Folder should be located in the input folder.
##############

2. Create .json-files
--------------
They should be located in the previously created folder.
##############

3. Create a runfile that will be sent as arg to the script
--------------
Format of runfile: Two rows are used at a time, first row is the location of the .json-file directed from the rt-bench folder, and second line is the name of the test.
##############

4. Run test
--------------
Run the tests with command:
$./xlaunch.sh <ip> <port> <name> <runfile> <testname>
##############

%------------------------%
%After tests are finished%
%------------------------%
5. Move the result folders into the testfolder
--------------
The testfolder has the same name as the folder created for the inputs and is located in the result folder
##############

6. Gather outputs
--------------
Use make_outputs.sh to gather supply function data from tests. It is run as:
$make_outputs.sh <runfile>
It is the same runfile that you created earlier
